# Reid Hoffman's latest release with tech writer Greg Beato, Superagency: What Could Possibly Go Right with Our AI Future.

---
Reid Hoffman and Greg Beato's book "Superagency: What Could Possibly Go Right with Our AI Future" was released on January 28, 2025[^1][^2]. This instant New York Times and USA Today bestseller offers an optimistic perspective on the potential of artificial intelligence to transform our world for the better[^6].

The book presents a roadmap for using AI inclusively and adaptively to improve lives and create positive change[^1]. While acknowledging challenges like disinformation and potential job disruptions, Hoffman and Beato focus on AI's potential to increase individual agency and create better societal outcomes[^2].

Key points from the book include:

1. AI as a "supertool" that can amplify human capabilities, similar to past innovations like the steam engine and internet[^3].
2. Visions of AI tutors personalizing education, accelerating medical research, and empowering individuals to navigate complex systems[^1].
3. A call to embrace AI with excitement and actively shape its development[^2].

"Superagency" has received praise from notable figures such as Bill Gates, Yuval Noah Harari, and Arianna Huffington[^6]. It is being taught at institutions like UPenn's Wharton School and Stanford University[^9].

Hoffman, co-founder of LinkedIn and partner at Greylock, brings his insider perspective as a tech visionary to this work[^1]. The book challenges readers to view AI's future through a lens of opportunity rather than fear, positioning it as a tool to unlock human potential and create extraordinary possibilities[^2].
